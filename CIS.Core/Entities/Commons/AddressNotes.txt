The Odd Balls
<Purok>
No one quite knows whether this is a political block or a geographical block? But it seems in the provinces purok is a way to find a person’s location.

<Postal Code Name>
The Philippine postal office attaches description(s) or name(s) to a postal code.

The conventions are confusing, it is not a barangay.  It does seem to be a village name (e.g. Merville, Greenhills) or a popular locality name (e.g. Binondo, Malate) when in metro manila, and it takes the municipality name when outside of Metro Manila.

This might be because of population size considerations however it causes location finding issues when used for large municipalities such as Davao City which carries a single postal code of 8000.  It may be that the postal office is extremely slow to react (similar to their mail services) to population changes, hence Davao with a population of more than a million is still a single postal code.

<Lot No / Block No>
This is the most annoying of all, we cannot route to a location with this information!  It is impossible to do with Navigation Software.  If we understand this correctly, this identifier is meant to be used by property developers to sell lots.
