<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Featured Touchless Users and Community Members</h1><h2>Community Member Zot</h2>Zot created Ideldes, an impressive sign language interpreter. The project captures gestures made ​​by the user&#39;s gloved hand with colored fingers, interpreting and translating. The application helps users learn sign language, verifying that registered signs are done correctly. Watch the  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1njTN9dp8">video demonstration</a> and visiting the <a href="http://www.ideldes.com">project homepage</a>
<h2>Community Member Thayine</h2>Thayine is a student of Informatics Institute of Technology in Sri Lanka, affiliated with University of Westminster, UK. She developed &quot;ChangeIt&quot;, a novel final year project that allows users to augment their appearance with virtual jewelry in real time. ChangeIt uses Touchless SDK to manipulate virtual images over a live camera feed with natural user interface techniques; very cool! Watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvwrlzcn8CU">video demonstration</a> and <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dENLcUVrTkRnN2YwdkpVbXBqZURrcWc6MQ#gid=0">offer feedback</a> on this great project.
<h2>Community Member Lucian Wischik</h2>Lucian is a developer for Microsoft in Visual Studio Managed Languages. He created an extremely fun and unique game using Touchless SDK called &quot;Stay In the Game&quot;. His game is written in Visual Basic and soon to be featured on Channel9 (I&#39;ll have the link for you soon). Beyond encouraging violence* through the highly physical gameplay of &quot;Stay In The Game&quot;; Lucian also put together a simple VB sample for Touchless SDK. Both projects will soon be hosted here, but for now, visit his <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vbtouchless">MSDN Code Gallery page</a> to scoop up his awesome projects.<br />*<i>Of course we don&#39;t encourage violence :-)</i>
<h2>Community Member Jonathan Synnott (jsynnott)</h2>Jonathan is a university student at the University of Ulster, Jordanstown in Northern Ireland. His final year project is creating a PC game that uses Touchless and a microphone as input. Check out <a href="http://www.jsynnott.com/category/final-year-project/">his blog</a> for more info and <b>definitely check out his great videos</b>.
<h2>Community Member Papnkukn</h2>Papnkukn developed several cool projects using Touchless <a href="http://[projects and videos">[projects and videos</a>|http://www.papnkukn.net/touchless]. TouchlessWPF is a very cool and simple WPF interface to Touchless. TouchlessKnight is a marker/mouse powered game that puts you in the seat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">Knight&#39;s Tour Problem</a>.  TouchlessCircuit lets you design circuits by manipulating individual elements with a marker/mouse. TouchlessCanvas is a general WPF component that simplifies WPF development with Touchless.
