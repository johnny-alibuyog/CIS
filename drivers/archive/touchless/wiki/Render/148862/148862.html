<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Featured Touchless Users and Community Members</h1><h2>Community Member Lucian Wischik</h2>Lucian is a developer for Microsoft in Visual Studio Managed Languages. He created an extremely fun and unique game using Touchless SDK called &quot;Stay In the Game&quot;. His game is written in Visual Basic and soon to be featured on Channel9 (I&#39;ll have the link for you soon). Beyond encouraging violence* through the highly physical gameplay of &quot;Stay In The Game&quot;; Lucian also put together a simple VB sample for Touchless SDK. Both projects will soon be hosted here, but for now, visit his <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vbtouchless">MSDN Code Gallery page</a> to scoop up his awesome projects.<br />*<i>Of course we don&#39;t encourage violence :-)</i>
<h2>Community Member Jonathan Synnott (jsynnott)</h2>Jonathan is a university student at the University of Ulster, Jordanstown in Northern Ireland.

<h2>Community Member Papnkukn</h2>Papnkukn developed several cool projects using Touchless <a href="http://[projects and videos">[projects and videos</a>|http://www.papnkukn.net/touchless]. TouchlessWPF is a very cool and simple WPF interface to Touchless. TouchlessKnight is a marker/mouse powered game that puts you in the seat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">Knight&#39;s Tour Problem</a>.  TouchlessCircuit lets you design circuits by manipulating individual elements with a marker/mouse. TouchlessCanvas is a general WPF component that simplifies WPF development with Touchless.
