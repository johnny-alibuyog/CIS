My project got only one week development time so i ask without even looking into the SDK source. Its also quite hard to understand for me.<br>\r\nWas thinking of a parameter like <strong>concentration of recognised pixels in a area</strong>, to track individual &quot;hotspots&quot; of the same color. <br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi Balex,<br>\r\nShort answer: Touchless isn't currently built to do this. If two markers look the same, both will match pixels of their shared colors.<br>\r\nAdding a notion of numerous &quot;hotspots&quot; for the same set of marker colors is a good idea; although it would be a significant change.<br>\r\nI'm quite backlogged with feature requests, I encourage skilled community members to consider contributing.<br>\r\n- Mike<br>\r\n",
