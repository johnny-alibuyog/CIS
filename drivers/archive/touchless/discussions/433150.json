Running on Windows 8 Pro on a tablet, however, we do see some issues. For some reason the webcam does not unload correctly, this causes subsequent problems accessing the webcam in general. Even 3rd party programs that use the webcam fail after using our program once.<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way to actually close the Webcam?<br />\n<br />\nLooking forward to any reply,<br />\nJohn<br />\n",
