I am currently working on finishing my PhD so I don't have that much time currently, but my areas of research are in illumination invariance. I wrote a tracker similar to this a few months ago which tracks colour patches (I used post-it notes) to drive the mouse. The main advantage was that I used my own custom colour models to allow for more reliable tracking over illumination and shading changes.</p>",
