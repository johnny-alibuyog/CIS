    "Html": "<p>Hi</p>\r\n<p>I'm trying to tweak the sample to work out when a marker is on screen and display different message boxes depending on the marker that appears onscreen, later this will call actual code rather than the test messages. I've got a messagebox working with&nbsp;Messagebox.show but I can't figure out how to tell which Marker is onscreen at that time to put in a select statement. I thought Marker.Equals might work but it doesn't appear to. Any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers</p>\r\n<p>Andrew</p>",

Then you can call your code only if exactly one marker is detected.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;I think using the Marker.Changed event (or, with my Patch, TouchlessMgr.MarkerChanged) and checking if a marker just became present (Marker.CurrentData.Present &amp;&amp; !Marker.PreviousData.Present)is thebest-fitting solution here...</p>",
