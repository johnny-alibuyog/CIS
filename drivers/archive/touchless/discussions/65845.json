What I want to do is have a series of bitmap files as markersand have those same ones printed on cards, so when the player draws a card it triggers the onscreen event. Not even quite sure where to start, any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Andrew</p>",

It provides you with algorithms to recognice such printed tiles and even output their position in space so you can incorporate 3D models into video images. Take a look at this project: <a href=\"http://www.mperfect.net/wpfAugReal/\">http://www.mperfect.net/wpfAugReal/</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you are not interested in the the 3D position you can also use something similar to Microsoft tag: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/tag/\">http://www.microsoft.com/tag/</a><br>However I'm not sure if there is an SDK that you can incorporate in your application.</p>\r\n<p>-Szymon</p>",
