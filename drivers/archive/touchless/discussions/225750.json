The video tutorial shows the &quot;Draw Demo&quot; and the source code available through download is for the &quot;Defend Demo&quot;. I have a requirement which is something like the &quot;Image Demo&quot; option in the demo application. I could not find the source code for the same.</p>\r\n<p>Can anyone please tell me if that is available? Also, my question is how is the map image in the &quot;Image Demo&quot; getting rendered in the display. Is that a graphics image being drawn on the picture box or is that an image inserted in the video buffer of the camera feed.</p>\r\n<p>Can someone please help!!</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Anshu Dutta</p>",
