I have to alternate between cameras by setting the \"TouchlessMgr.CurrentCamera\" to each one successively while I would need to run them in their own thread with their own TouchlessMgr and Camera handle.  Any advice on that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Louis</p>",

I'm using Touchless to manage the webcams, but I have a rather big problem. Those webcams run 1080p at 30fps and they can't be used asynchronously because TouchlessMgr is monolithic. I have to alternate between cameras by setting the \"TouchlessMgr.CurrentCamera\" to each one successively while I would need to run them in their own thread with their own TouchlessMgr and Camera handle. Any advice on that would be greatly appreciated.
