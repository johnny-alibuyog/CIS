Here frame rate dropped to about 10 fps. But it turned out that the problem was caused by graphics drivers for Intel GMA 965. I used a DropShadowEffect on video border in the MainWindow, but on this graphics adapter its not hardware accelerated. When I removed this effect it runs in 640x480 @ max 40% CPU with one marker.\r\n",

I got some inspiration after watching the PDS session about developing with Surface SDK (<a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC17/\">http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC17/</a>). They have a set of WPF Controls that can work with multi-touch input. But the controls work on top of some driver that sends routed events for each contact. I think we should be able to use the same model for Touchless. But eventually for the end user it should be as easy as to put a TouchlessCanvas instead of regular canvas to get multi-touch input (or TouchlessScatterView). I will be prototyping it this week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Szymon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
