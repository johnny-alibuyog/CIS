    "Html": "<p>Hmm that was does say it captures video at 1600 res. I wonder if that is a marketing gimic or if it is actual (what I mean is maybe it only does that resolution at very low frame rates). Does it look worse when you capture in Touchless than when you are using it in any other program? When I connected a cam with 320 resolution, it had 320 in touchless and when i connected 640 res, it had 640.&nbsp; So touchless is capable of multiple resolutions, but I'm not sure if there is a limit.</p>",
