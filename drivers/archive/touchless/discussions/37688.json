Then I\r\nincluded the image (and the marker data) in my application as a\r\nresource. After that, I included the touchless-tracking in my application using the following code:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmgr = new TouchlessMgr();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\nmgr.CurrentCamera = mgr.Cameras[0];<br>\r\n_width = mgr.CurrentCamera.CaptureWidth;<br>\r\n_height = mgr.CurrentCamera.CaptureHeight;<br>\r\nMarker marker = mgr.AddMarker(&quot;testmarker&quot;, Resources.image, new System.Drawing.Point(99, 84), 19.5f); // this is the markerdata created in the demo application.<br>\r\nmarker.OnChange += new EventHandler&lt;MarkerEventArgs&gt;(Marker_OnChange);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the tracking works fine for some seconds, but then it stops and I get a NullReferenceException. Unfortunately, I do not get any more information about the source of the exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this a known problem and is there a workaround?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreetings.<br>\r\n",
