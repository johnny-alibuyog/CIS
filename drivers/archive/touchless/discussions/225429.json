One out of them is a demo but I could not make out what the others are.</p>\r\n<p>There is a project called -The executable - This seems to have some WCF services. I am wondering how are they used in the project.</p>\r\n<p>In the demo file there is an option of &quot;Start Image Demo&quot;. I need something like that for my current requirement. Is there any documentation on that? The demo video shows the Drawing demo but not this. I am interested in knowing how to make my overlayed objects interact with change in marker positions (more like the Image Demo).</p>\r\n<p>Can anyone please help?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Anshu Dutta</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
