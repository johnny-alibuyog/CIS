Too bad my camera is very slow, so it wasn't very usable, but I will go out to get a better cam.<br>There's also a lot more work to do on the plugin, because now it's actually just the two programs tied together: you have to create markers with the Touchless Demo, save them and MultiTouch Vista opens them to use.</p>\r\n<p>But I was able to move my mouse in Windows 7 without touching anything, so it's a start!</p>\r\n<p><br>Kind regards,<br>amelsfort</p>",
