I'd be willing to help out if you upload a patch or send me code.</p>\r\n<p>To answer your question, the best thing to do would be to re-add the marker in very different lighting conditions, but you might be able to tweak the marker threshold sufficiently to make it work (a lower thresh will match more pixels). Otherwise, you might be able to adjust your webcam settings to compensate for limited lighting differences by using/tweaking automatic&nbsp;gain / night mode / exposure settings, depending on your camera's software. It might also be possible to add some controls that would offset Touchless's detected colors to compensate for lighting differences, but you'd have to perform some brightness sampling or add manual user controls to make that work, and I'm not sure how well it'd play out.</p>\r\n<p>If you're able to contribute, you'll be helping other people with the same requests!</p>\r\n<p>- Mike</p>",
