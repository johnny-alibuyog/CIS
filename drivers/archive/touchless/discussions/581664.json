My code is written in C#. In one of the demo I saw someone using CurrentCamera.CaptureHeight and CurrentCamera.CaptureWidth to set the height and width of the image, however these are ready only properties. Is there any other way to change the size.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nSameer<br />\n",
