I think they are also written in C# or C++, I'm a bit more farmiliar with VB than C.&nbsp; What file should I start with? There are several files in the sample folder. Does each file show a different aspect of touchless? What are the file's showing? Also are the files suppose to fun, I get an error about &quot;source control not found&quot; when I try to run them.</p>\r\n<p>For my project I'm looking for as something as simple just creating a marker and being able to read the X and Y coordinate data and outputing information through SerialPort.</p>",

Please keep the video up, I (and I'm sure others) need to study it carefully.&nbsp; Since I'm still just learning VB I think I'll switch over to C# to make using touchless sdk easier.&nbsp; I'll submit my project once it's done!</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again! and nice video quality too.</p>\r\n<p>Mahhari.</p>",
