      "Message": "I was able to reproduce this problem by a stroke of luck. I believe WebCamLib.dll isn't being built correctly in some situations. Try copying the attached WebCamLib.dll into the folder where you are launching Touchless.Demo.exe or Touchless.WPF.exe and try again. Please let me know if that helps. Also, are you running a 64-bit OS and are you using Visual Studio Team Explorer? I'll work on a fix asap.",
