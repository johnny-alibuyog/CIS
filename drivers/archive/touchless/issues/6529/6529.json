    "Description": "This may be a little ways away for the SDK but I think it's quite do-able...\nÂ \nHow about using a stereoscopic image? What I mean is.. two cameras, set X-inches apart pointing to the same area by X-degrees.. a-la-human eyes. You could identify the same marker on both images. The SDK could track and interpolate the position based on both image. With a little trig you could figure out X,Y,Z relative motion.  This would lead to all kinds of marker tracking improvements and probably help with changing light too. Not to mention adding a Z-axis would let you do some neat wiimote-like tricks.",
