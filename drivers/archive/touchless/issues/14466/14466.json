    "Description": "I downloaded the sdk source code 55790 and converted to a Visual Studio 2010 solution without any error. But when I tried to compile the solution, it fails with many erros that could be resumed that WebCamLib does not exist. I tried to compile the WebCamLib project only, but it fails with 'qedit.h':No such file or directory in line 19 from WebCamLib.cpp. I tried to reference the binary WebCamLib.dll that I got from the demo, and now Visual Studio complains that it is not a valid .dll and the refence is no set.\nWhat am I doing wrong?",
