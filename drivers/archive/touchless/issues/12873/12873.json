    "Description": "Hello @ll,\n \nI just tried to compile the newest version of Touchless SDK. It's working great, but when I change the webcam (I have two) I'm getting an exception \"Graph builder was null!\". Then I need to restart the application and it'll work great again, till I try to change my webcam. Any idea what the problem is?\n \nThank for all your work! ;)\n \nMichael\n \nPS. If you need addition information, just ask!",
