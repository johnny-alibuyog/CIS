    "Description": "From the demo, it looks like it could be possible to create 'Soft' buttons...\n...or, buttons within the interface and screen. Buttons that could be 'touched' with a marker. \nÂ \nOne example would be a button that changes the color of the line that the 'Draw' Demo is drawing with.  Move a marker over a red button... and that marker now draws with a red line, etc.",
