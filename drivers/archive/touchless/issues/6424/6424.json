    "Description": "Definitely.\nThis should also be easier to do, just hide the gui and everything and let two markers control mouse movements. Everything can be done minority style with the markers (tapes/LEDs/Nailpolish?!) on fingers of the two hands. A Click can be interpreted as the disappearance/appearance of a marker, similarly some such thing for double click and drag and drop.\nÂ \nYou can be sitting away from your chair and playing/pausing/volume adjusting your movies while the complete time high fiving your buddies! (well not high fiving coz that could you know...)",
